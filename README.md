# Image-Manipulation

## Description

The Maze Solver project in C++ utilizes the breadth-first search(BFS) algorithm and various data structures to efficiently solve maze puzzles. The project includes functionalities for drawing and decoding mazes, applying BFS algorithm for finding solutions, and visualizing the solved path. It employs stacks, queues, and deques to store and retrieve cells during maze traversal. The project provides a user-friendly interface, allowing users to draw or load maze images and observe step-by-step animations of solving process. Overall, it showcases the practical application of graph theory, algorithm design, and data structures in solving complex problems.
